          * Question 92:
          * 
          * a) As it is created in the constructor, it should be a readonly field.
          * 
          * - CORRECT
          * 
          * b) As it is a literal, it should be a const.
          * 
          * - CORRECT
          * 
          * c) As it changes depending on constructor, it should be a readonly field.
          * 
          * - CORRECT
          * 
          * d) If it's only needed inside a method, it could be a const declared inside the method, or passed in
          *    as a readonly parameter.
          *    
          *    - CORRECT
          *    
          * e) Array should be readonly as its individual elements could change, but the array itself remains.
          * 
          * - CORRECT
          * 
          * f) Pass in the parameter using 'in' as a readonly parameter. Then use it to create a const variable, or assign to an existing regular variable.
          * 
          *  - CORRECT
          * 
          * */
